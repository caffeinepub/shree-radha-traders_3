      "requirement": "Admin can delete individual product photos (multiple photo upload/delete capability)",

      "requirement": "Image zoom functionality for product gallery",
      "reason": "ProductLightbox opens a dialog with the product image, but there is no actual zoom functionality (e.g., pinch-to-zoom, zoom controls, or magnification on hover). The lightbox displays the image at a fixed size within a dialog.",
